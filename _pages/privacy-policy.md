<br>

## Applicability of this Privacy Policy
This Privacy Policy applies to FluidStride's mobile application ("App"), the FluidStride website ("Website"), and other interactions (e.g., customer service inquiries, user conferences, etc.) you may have with FluidStride. If you do not agree with the terms, do not access or use the App, Website or any other aspect of FluidStride's services.

**THIS PRIVACY POLICY DOES NOT APPLY TO ANY THIRD PARTY APPLICATIONS OR SOFTWARE THAT INTEGRATE WITH THE APP OR WEBSITE, OR ANY OTHER THIRD PARTY PRODUCTS, SERVICES OR BUSINESSES.**

## 1.0 Information about Your Personal Data

This Privacy Policy relates to data about you, your devices, and your interaction with our Services.

> "Personal Data" is information that can be used to identify you, directly or indirectly, alone or together with other information. This includes things such as your full name, email address, phone number, precise location, device IDs, certain cookie and network identifiers, and "Fitness and Wellness Data."

FluidStride collects, uses, and processes Personal Data as outlined in this Privacy Policy to provide you our fitness services.

## 1.1 App Device Permisions

FluidStride  accesses and records camera sensor and microphone data, which is used for the purpose of taking photos and recording videos, to fulfil its purpose as a camera-based running gait analysis app.

FluidStride requires permission to "access photos, media and files on your devices", as this permission is required for Android to save resultant files such as photos and videos to your device.

Our app require us to collect images and other information from your device’s camera and photos. For example, you won’t be able to analyze videos or use videos from your camera roll unless we can access your camera or photos.

Since FluidStride also uses operating system APIs, you should review relevant privacy policies such as for your device, manufacturer, operating system and/or Google accounts. For example:

- Apps/services such as cloud services on your device may auto-upload photos and videos that are saved on your device.

### 1.2 How Personal Data is Collected and Used by FluidStride

Your Personal Data is collected in various ways for different purposes, including:

1.  When you input Fitness and Wellness data within our FluidStride App and Services or use features that collect or infer such data from mobile device sensors (e.g. FluidStride Sessions)

    **"Fitness and Wellness Data"** includes data you provide related to your training (e.g., running mileage), injuries, fitness goals, height, weight, measurements, fitness level, heart rate, BMI, biometric data, and similar types of data relating to physiological condition, and activity. We collect this data in order to provide the Services and to tailor features and services to your interests and goals, including providing workout plans, training- and coaching-related services, and general recommendations.

2.  When you use or interact with the device camera or your personal camera roll in the FluidStride App.

    [expand]

     Our services require us to collect images, video and other information from
     your device’s camera and photos. For example, you won’t be able to perform
     gait analysis or share training videos unless we can access your camera or photos.

    FluidStride allows you to share training videos and achievements to friends
    through third-party products and services. Use of third-party products and
    services to share data is done at your own risk and subject
    to the terms of conditions for such services.

you share and with whom you share it.

<br>

## 2.0 Data Retention and Control Over Your Information

Your Personal Data is retained only on your device as long as the FluidStride app is installed.
This data is kept so that you can use it to compare results between different training sessions.
Deleting the app will also delete the Personal Data collected by FluidStride from your device.
Individual training sessions (videos and inferred data) can be deleted by the user at any time
and thus removed from your device.

We implement appropriate technical and organizational safeguards to protect against unauthorized or unlawful processing of Personal Data and against accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure of, or access to Personal Data. Please be advised, however, that we cannot fully eliminate security risks associated with the storage and transmission of Personal Data.

**Links to Other Websites.** Please note that this Privacy Policy does not apply to the practices of companies that we do not own or control or to people that we do not employ or manage. Our Services may provide a link or otherwise provide access to Third Party Sites. We provide these links merely for your convenience. We have no control over, do not review, and are not responsible for Third Party Sites, their content, or any goods or services available through the Third Party Sites. Our Privacy Policy does not apply to Third Party Sites, and any data you provide to Third Party Sites, you provide at your own risk. We encourage you to review the privacy policies of any Third Party Sites with that you interact with.

## 4.0 Children
We do not knowingly collect Personal Data online from children under 13 (note that the minimum age may vary based on location, and on local law). Our app is also not intended for—and we don’t direct them to—anyone under 13. If you become aware that a child has provided us with Personal Data without parental consent, please contact us through our Support Team. If we become aware that a child under 13 has provided us with Personal Data without parental consent, we will take steps to remove the data and cancel the child's account.

## 5.0 Revisions to the Privacy Policy

We may change this Privacy Policy from time to time. But when we do, we’ll let you know one way or another. Sometimes, we’ll let you know by revising the date at the top of the Privacy Policy that’s available on our website and mobile application. Other times, we may provide you with additional notice (such as adding a statement to our websites’ homepages or providing you with an in-app notification).
