# About FluidStride
FluidStride is a running gait analysis app that uses modern computer vision and
machine learning to turn your phone into a virtual running coach! By analyzing your
running gait, you can improve your efficiency and identify potential injury risks.

Regardless of your fitness level or where you live, we believe that running
is a sport for everyone! We want to keep running fun, but also put science and
engineering into making it easier to run faster. Smartphones are some of the most
accessible devices around the world and can be very powerful. However, we believe
you can do more with your phone than just basic timing and distance measurement.

Running is not just about stats and how long it took you to get from point A to
point B. It's also about how you got there and the journey you took. FluidStride
aims to focus on more on you personally and your running journey. We want to
help you enjoy running by keeping you training safely and effectively.

Here at FluidStride, we're very much driven by passion rather than a desire for
profit. If you have any feedback or suggestions, feel free to reach out!

If you have time, we would really appreciate it if you could fill out our [survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1NwSoW5W-vWgOdfknK5lVLexVOeUVa-9lj7vrwmPxHHA/)!


# About Me
Hi! My name is Sean and I'm an avid runner and a computer engineering student. I
started FluidStride as a hobby project based on my previous competitive running
experience at the high school provincial level.

I was inspired to start this project when I noticed some imbalances in my own running
gait. Furthermore, I mainly trained independently and felt like I missed out on the
potential development and feedback that I could have gotten with a regular coach.

I decided to start FluidStride to see if there were ways to train smarter using
recent computer vision research. So far the results have been promising and I
hope to have a first version of FluidStride available to the public in January 2021!

Happy running!
