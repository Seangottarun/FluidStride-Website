# About FluidStride

Hi! My name is Sean and I'm an avid runner who started FluidStride as a hobby project.
I was inspired to start this project when I noticed that my running form sometimes
feels imbalanced. Furthermore, I wanted to see if there were ways to train smarter
using recent computer vision research.

FluidStride is very much driven by passion rather than a desire for profit. If
you have any feedback or suggestion, feel free to reach out! Hopefully FluidStride
can help you become a better runner!

Happy running!
