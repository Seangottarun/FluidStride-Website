# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ's)

## How do I use FluidStride?
1. #### How do I analyze my running form?

    [expand]

    After downloading our app, you can analyze your form with these simple steps
    1. Find a nice open space or use a treadmill where you can run freely
    2. Select "New Analysis" from the bottom navigation menu and record a new session
      - This requires a phone stand or a friend to take a video of you running
    3. After the video is recorded, select the "Analyze session now" option
      - This make take up to a minute to process your video depending on your phone
      and the video duration.
    4. Your running session report should now be able for you to view.
    5. Feel free to record another session in the future to compare results and
    measure progress!

## How does FluidStride work?
1. #### How does FluidStride accurately analyze running form?

    [expand]

    Using recent research in machine learning and computer vision, FluidStride is
    able to take a video and detect the 2D locations of various joints and keypoints.
    We then use the 2D keypoints to determine their 3D position for better analytics.
    Read our [How FluidStride Works](https://myfluidstride.com/howitworks/) section to learn more.

2. #### How do you know that FluidStride actually improves running efficiency and reduces injury risk?

    [expand]

    FluidStride's gait analysis software performs kinematic analysis to study the
    movement of your limbs while you run. Using existing biomechanics research,
    our kinematic analysis results can be used to identify potential injury risks.

    Due to limitations of smartphones and existing computer vision models, it is
    also important to note that our kinematic analysis results may also be inaccurate.
    We are also actively working on improving accuracy and developing improved
    algorithms. Furthermore, after every analysis we provide a "confidence score"
    to roughly indicate how accurate the results may be. If your analysis has
    a low confidence score, we recommend trying to find an area with better testing
    conditions and/or contacting us to see how the issue can be resolved.

3. #### Does my phone support FluidStride?

    [expand]

    Currently, FluidStride only supports Android phones newer than Android 5.0 (Lollipop)
    which was released in 2014. Most recent Android phones should work, but if you
    run into issues, feel free to contact us.

    There are plans to develop an iOS version, but no version is currently available.
