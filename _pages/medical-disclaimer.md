Your safety is very important to us. FluidStride does not replace the advice or treatment

or injuries affecting your ability to run, please consult a healthcare provider
before using our app.

This gait analysis is based on published gait analysis and computer vision research.
Research references are provided on our site in the [references]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/references.md %})
section. We regularly review gait analysis research every three months and update
the information and gait analysis procedure when necessary.

All information is merely for educational and informational purposes. **It is not
meant as a substitute for professional advice. Always seek the advice of your
physician or other qualified health providers with any questions you may have
regarding a medical condition.** Never disregard professional medical advice or
delay in seeking it because of something you have read on the FluidStride app!

Use the running app only when you feel you can do so without falling or hurting
yourself. If you are under the care of a healthcare provider, follow all advice of
your healthcare provider and perform only the exercises approved by your healthcare
provider. Your use of the FluidStride app is strictly voluntary. Take care when using
